Krusty Krab Fictional Business Website

In this project, our goal is to create a working website for the Krusty Krab that both uses the skills we've been learning this semester and fits the personality and image of our business. We will use HTML and CSS to create an appropriate website for the Krusty Krab that fits the requirements of our assignment.

Our group members include: Savannah Kimball, Lauren McConaughey, and Leah Stiff (formerly) 

 Savannah was in charge of the html writing, Leah was in charge of and handled most of the CSS writing (with Savannah taking over when she left), and Lauren was in charge of the content writing/style choices.

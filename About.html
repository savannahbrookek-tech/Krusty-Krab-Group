      Come Spend Your Money Here!

Ahoy Mateys! Surf on over to the Krusty Krab, where every patty is made with profit perfection in mind! Founded in the early 50’s by Eugene H. Krabs, our crew has been serving up mouth-watering, high-quality (for the most part), and nutritious* food from our grub gallery.

      This nautical-themed fast food restaurant is home to the famous Krabby Patty, a secret formula so tasty, many others have tried to snatch it! Argh-argh-argh-argh-argh! They can try but they will never succeed! 

Our menu isn’t limited to the Krabby Patty. Take a bite out of our fresh, crispy-golden Coral Bits and Kelp Rings. Wash it down with a bubbly Seafoam Soda and refreshing Kelp Shake, ye won’t regret it!

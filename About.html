Ahoy Mateys! Surf on over to the Krusty Krab, where every patty is made with <del>profit</del> perfection in mind! Founded in the early 50’s by Eugene H. Krabs, our crew has been serving up mouth-watering, high-quality (for the most part), and nutritious* food from our grub gallery.

      This nautical-themed fast food restaurant is home to the famous Krabby Patty, a secret formula so tasty, many others have tried to snatch it! Argh-argh-argh-argh-argh! They can try but they will never succeed! 

Our menu isn’t limited to the Krabby Patty. Take a bite out of our fresh, crispy-golden Coral Bits and Kelp Rings. Wash it down with a bubbly Seafoam Soda and refreshing Kelp Shake, ye won’t regret it!

      So come aboard, with yer wallets, to The Krusty Krab!
